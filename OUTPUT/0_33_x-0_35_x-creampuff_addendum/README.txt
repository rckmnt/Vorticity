We identified the time slices 0_33 through 0_35 to have double surface conditions making them look like creampuffs and slipping through our initial pass of stitching and exporting single topology FBXs.

Most of these remain untouched from before, but the cream puff conditions have been hand stitched and I appended a "_cp" to the FBX filename. In the joining process, old separate meshes were deprecated and took on the name of another individual mesh and as such there are spaces in the naming convention. Not a problem, just the way it worked out.

These 3 time slices can be slipped into the FBX export from 6/27 without issue, deleting 33-35 and replacing. The rest of the timeslices remain unchanged.
